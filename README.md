# News Research Tool using OpenAI API, Langchain, FAISS and Streamlit

## Problem Statement

Research Analysts currently face challenges in efficiently conducting news research due to the vast amount of information available and the lack of streamlined tools. There is a need for a comprehensive News Research. This is enabled with the use of LLM models from either OpenAI / HuggingFace, Langchain, Faiss - acts as vector database, and Streamlit - to provide UI libraries in Python to enhance the research process and improve efficiency.

## Topics Covered

- Loaders - TextLoader, UnstructuredURLLoader
- Text Splitters
- FAISS - Index and Vector Database
- Retrieval (RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain)
- Streamlit UI and Project Coding

Please go through the notebooks in the research folder to know how the above features are implemented.

## Running the app

1. Install the requirements - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Store your OpenAI API Key in .env file which is to be located in the root folder of this project. It should be in the following format.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY
```

3. Run the app - `streamlit run main.py`
